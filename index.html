<h1>super cars</h1>
<p>
A supercar, also known as an exotic car, is a street-legal sports car with race track-like<br> power, speed, and handling, plus a certain subjective cachet linked to pedigree<br> and/or exclusivity.[1] The term 'supercar' is frequently used for the extreme fringe of<br> powerful,<br> low-bodied mid-engine luxury sportscars. A low-profile car may have limited ground <br>clearance, but a handling-favorable center of gravity and a smaller frontal area than a<br> front engined car. These characteristics can reduce supercars' aerodynamic drag, <br>enabling higher top speeds. Since the 2000s,[citation needed] the term hypercar has come<br> into use for the highest-performance supercars.

<h2>
1.Bugatti Chiron Super Sport</h2>
<img src="buggati.png"width="250"height="250">
<p>
Behold: the world’s fastest production car. Yep, the go-faster Super Sport is based on<br> the Bugatti Chiron that Andy Wallace piloted to 304.773mph back in 2019,<br> and features an 8.0-litre quad-turbo V16 producing an extra 100bhp over the standard<br> Chiron. All in, that’s 1,578bhp at your disposal. In fact, there’s just one difference<br> to the Chiron which smashed the 300mph barrier – the top speed has been limited to a mere 273mph</p><hr>

<h2>
2.Rimac Nevera</h2>
<img src="nevera.png"width="250"height="250">
<p>
“The Nevera is astonishingly fast. Fast in a way that’s tricky to put into words, either<br> while you’re sitting in it trying to process what the hell is happening to your mind,<br> body and soul when you nail the throttle, or a few days later writing about it,"<br> wrote Jason Barlow when he got the call to test drive the Rimac Nevera in Croatia last <br>year. So allow us to hit you with some numbers instead: courtesy of a 120kWh battery,<br> four motors driving each wheel individually, and a power output equivalent to 1,914bhp<br> and 1,740lb ft of torque, Mate Rimac’s hypercar is capable of 0-60mph in 1.85 seconds,<br> 100mph in 4.3secs, and 186mph in 9.3secs – on to a 258mph max.</p><hr>

<h2>3.Pininfarina Battista</h2>
<img src="battista.png"width="250"height="250">
<p>
Meet the sister car to the Rimac Nevera. It’s based around the same powertrain technology, electrical architecture<br> and carbon core (Rimac supplies the internal gubbins), but wears an Italian frock of Pininfarina design. Worried<br> about charging? No drama, Pininfarina has agreed a deal with ChargePoint, meaning free charging for five years.<br> Which means, theoretically, if you get enough miles under your belt, you could break even on the £2m purchase price.</p><hr>

<h2>
4.Lamborghini Sián</h2>
<img src="img.ping.jpg"width="250"height="250">
<p>
With a name derived from the Bolognese dialect for lightning bolt, it’s no surprise that electrification is the Sián’s<br> talking point, too. It features a tuned version of the Aventador SVJ’s 6.5-litre, naturally aspirated V12, with <br>another 34bhp of electrical oomph (courtesy of lithium-ion supercapacitors) added for a total of 808bhp. And<br> while that electroboost may not sound a whole lot in the grand scheme of things, it helps to smooth out the savage<br> gearshifts that have plagued Lambos since the Aventador.</p><hr>

<h2>
5.Ferrari 812 Competizione</h2>
<img src="Ferrari.png"width="250"heidht="250">
<p>
Quite possibly the end of an era – so get those tissues ready ­– as the 812 Competizione might well be the last Ferrari<br> production car to get a raucous naturally-aspirated V12 without the assistance of any e-fizz or turbos. No matter <br>how many times - or bluntly - we asked, Ferrari’s Puma-clad engineers dodged the question like greased politicians.<br> Whether we like it or not, we know there’s a sell-by date on these big, thirsty, exciting twelve cylinders. And we’ve<br> already seen forced induction and hybridisation come in to do some of the heavy lifting with regards to horsepower<br> at Ferrari. But, if this is the last hurrah, it's quite a remarkable bit of punctuation to end an age of engines.
<br>
<br>
<
The 812 Competizione is the pumped up and finessed version of the 812 Superfast. A 789bhp front-engined<br> two-seat super GT that wasn’t named ironically. So think of the 819bhp 812 Comp as an 812 Superfaster. Or Very<br>Superfaster. It follows on from a spiky lineage of race-inspired front engine rear-wheel-drive V12 Ferraris; the <br>brow moistening 599 GTO and psychotic F12tdf. Both of those required substantial bravery to tame, and<br> the newest evolution isn’t any less intimidating.</p><hr>
